# MusicPlayer
I created a web-based music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase and play my original musical compositions. The player features a responsive design with intuitive controls, allowing users to play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust the volume seamlessly.

I built the interface with HTML and CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Using JavaScript, I handled audio playback functionality, including dynamic track loading and real-time progress updates, providing a smooth listening experience.

This project allowed me to blend my passion for music with web development, resulting in an interactive platform to share my work while demonstrating my front-end development skills.
